* Currently

** Generally

   - Experimental utilities to console operators of consoles.
   - A study in the design of terminal applications.
   - A study of [[https://github.com/pqwy/notty][Notty]], the OCaml library for declarative terminal graphics.

   The aim is to develop a deeply modular, declarative, extensible, suite for
   developing terminal tools.

** Specifically

   The following features are in various stages of early development, and should
   be considered landmarks in a proving ground:

   - The ~Consolate_term~ module, providing the ~Loop~ functor, which is a
     general interface to the Notty terminal event loop for any module
     satisfying the ~Program~ interface.
   - The ~Composition~ functor, facilitating the composition of complex programs
     from simpler, independent components.
   - A simple line editor.
   - A simple text editor, implemented as a composer on the simple line editor.
   - A terminal application that treats JSON files as config files and
     facilitates structured, easy, safe editing of values without risk to the
     syntax or semantics of the configuration framework. In early development.

* Eventually?

  - Robust, minimal utilities to console operators of consoles.
